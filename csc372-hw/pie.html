        <li><strong>Preheat Oven:</strong> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Make Lemon Filling:</strong> In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 cup sugar, flour, cornstarch,
            and salt. Stir in water, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until
            mixture comes to a boil. Stir in butter. Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 1/2 cup of
            hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to
            cook while stirring constantly until thick. Remove from heat. Pour filling into baked pastry shell.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Meringue:</strong> In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy. Add sugar
            gradually, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form. Spread meringue over pie, sealing the edges at the
